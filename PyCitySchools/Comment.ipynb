    "\n",
    "The student with the highest overall passing rate comes from a small school.\n",
    "The student with the second-highest overall passing rate attends an independent school.\n",
    "Bailey High School has the highest overall passing rate among all the schools.\n",
    "There is a negative relationship between the budget per student and the overall passing score, meaning that schools with higher budgets per student tend to have lower overall passing rates.\n",
    "In summary, the analysis indicates that smaller schools and independent schools have students with higher overall passing rates. Bailey High School stands out as the top-performing school, while a higher budget per student does not necessarily result in better academic performance.\n"
